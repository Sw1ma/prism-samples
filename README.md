# Prism Samples: Using Prism Unity Forms
These are samples that demonstrate how I use various Prism features with Xamarin.Forms. These samples are not part of the official Prism Library.

This repository is also used to explore and learn [GitHub features](https://github.com/features) to the fullest.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [MasterDetailPage w/ TabbedPages](https://github.com/Sw1ma/prism-samples/tree/master/MasterDetailTabbed) | How to handle MasterDetailPage Navigation in combination with TabbedPages. Notice the [App](https://github.com/Sw1ma/prism-samples/blob/master/MasterDetailTabbed/MasterDetailTabbed/App.xaml.cs) file as a quickstart to see how I intended the navigation to work in this scenario.
